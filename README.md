xbjava8integration
==================

Java 8 project to hold unit tests for XMLBeam that need JDK8 features. 
Since XMLBeam is a Java 6 project, integration tests with Java 8 need to be in a separate project.
Notice that you still benefit from Java 8 default methods in XMLBeam.
The Java 6 compatibility is not a restriction, but an extension.
